This script can be used to create addressobjects for your fortigate. 
Note that the input file needs to be whitespace seperated for this script to work in the following order:

1. name    
2. type    
3. address     
4. netmask         
5. associated-interface

There are no checks for invalid inputs and the code is not streamlined. All feedback is very much welcome.
